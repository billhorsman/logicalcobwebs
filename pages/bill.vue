        I'm a computer programmer nearly 30 years experience in software
        development. I've been building web applications since 1997 - first in
        Java and then, since the start of 2007, in
        <a class="whitespace-no-wrap" href="https://rubyonrails.org/"
          >Ruby on Rails</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        I like to build beautiful interfaces that do useful jobs so that people
        can get things done quickly, easily and with fewer mistakes.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have used Ruby on Rails every day of my working life for the past 12
        years. Over time, Javascript and frameworks like
        <a class="whitespace-no-wrap" href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> have
        become increasingly important.

            >28 years worth of mistakes; doing things the hard way; learning
            from what went wrong. Trying to learn even more from what went
            right.</span

            all about the thrill of the new - it's also about detail and making
            it work.</span

          <span
            >Striving to make things as simple as possible - whether that's for
            the end user or for another developer on my team. Or me, six months
            down the road. Clever solutions aren't necessarily cool.</span

        <li>
          <span
            >Rigorous, automatic testing so I have the confidence to make
            changes.</span

        I've worked for banks, telecoms, government, education, distribution,
        retail and news media. Some of it has been at the leading edge using the
        latest tools; some of it has been the rigor of maintaining a financial
        system. All of it has taught me a great deal: language skills like Java
        and Ruby; coding skills like testing and transparency; business skills
        like communication and commitment.

        I now work for Team Tito helping to build
        <a href="https://ti.to">Tito</a> and <a href="https://vi.to">Vito</a>.
